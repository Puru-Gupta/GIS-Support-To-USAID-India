# Geospatial Application Development and GIS Integration for USAID  

## Overview  
This project involved developing interactive geospatial applications and data visualizations to support USAID’s technical team in decision-making and prioritization of high-need areas. The solutions were designed to align with program objectives by integrating GIS technologies, interactive mapping, and spatial analysis tools.

## Key Contributions  

### 📌 Collaboration with USAID  
- Worked closely with USAID’s technical team to **gather and analyze project requirements**.  
- Ensured geospatial solutions aligned with **program objectives, operational needs, and decision-making priorities**.  
- Defined key geographic indicators, data sources, and expected outputs to enhance spatial intelligence.  

### 🗺️ Development of Interactive Geospatial Applications  
- Built **multilayer maps using Leaflet**, incorporating **layer control features** for better user interaction.  
- Integrated **real-time and static spatial data** to provide a **comprehensive geographic overview** of project locations.  
- Enabled users to toggle between multiple datasets for **better visualization and insights**.  

### 📍 Spatial Data Processing & Mapping  
- Processed and visualized spatial data using **shapefiles (SHP)** for precise **administrative boundary representation**.  
- Optimized web-based mapping with **GeoJSON and TopoJSON** for enhanced performance and spatial accuracy.  

### 🔍 Dynamic Drilldown Functionality  
- Implemented **drilldown capabilities**, allowing users to **explore multiple administrative levels** dynamically.  
- Enabled **granular analysis from national to village-level insights**, improving geographic data usability.  

### 📊 Advanced Data Visualization & Analytics  
- Designed **comparative charts with customized styling**, linking them to **geospatial visualizations**.  
- Utilized **D3.js and Chart.js** to create **interactive and insightful analytics dashboards**.  
- Allowed **trend analysis, spatial comparisons, and data-driven decision-making**.  

### 🌍 Impact & Outcomes  
- Provided **actionable geospatial insights** to help USAID **prioritize high-need areas** effectively.  
- Developed methodologies to overlay **demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related data** for **targeted interventions**.  
- Enabled optimized **resource allocation** through **accurate spatial analysis**.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Leaflet.js** – Interactive mapping and GIS visualization  
- **D3.js, Chart.js** – Data visualization and analytics  
- **GeoJSON, TopoJSON, SHP (Shapefiles)** – Spatial data processing  
- **PostGIS, QGIS** – Geospatial database and analysis
